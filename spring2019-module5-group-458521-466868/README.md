#Creative Portion#
* Added the option to include an event's location when creating an event. The event location will show up upon clicking on the event. Users are also able to edit the location.
* Added (optional) event tags for events (School, Extracurriculars, and Social). The tags show up on the top of the calendar and can be selected or unselected to display the specific tagged events. In order for this to work accurately, only one tag can be checked at a time.
* Added ability to share events with another user. Shared events will show up on both user's calendars and both users can edit/delete the event.
